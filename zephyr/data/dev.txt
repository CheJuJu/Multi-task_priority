The commit a5b6215a060676d07f9a5119f0a05ffa2edc8d85 added three elements to the : _kernel_openocd_offsets . array without raising the : OPENOCD_OFFSET_VERSION . as was instructed in the comment above the array . So even if OpenOCD was able to use those new values , it would not be able to determine if they exist . But since our patch to OpenOCD right now rejects unknown versions ( see zephyrproject-rtos/openocd #3 ) , I suggest to change the meaning of the : OPENOCD_OFFSET_VERSION . field to inform only about in compatible changes . For detecting backward compatible additions to the end of the array like the commit mentioned above , we should add a new variable to the . openocd_debug section that has the value : ARRAY_SIZE(_kernel_openocd_offsets ) . ( C does not allow us to put this value inside the array ) . Also note that our patch to OpenOCD is not yet upstream ( #2933 ) . I'd be willing to make pull requests with the necessary changes , both for this issue and for zephyrproject-rtos/openocd .	1	0

Reported by Inaky Perez-Gonzalez : As a developer , I need a consistent way to generate crypto-grade entropy that can be used to seed pseudo-random-number-generators for crypto , secure storage and hashing . The subsystem shall support : - binding HW sources of entropy to the subsystem - harvesting entropy from said sources : -- the entropy sources that can generate entropy as part of their normal operation shall be able to push entropy to the subsystem when enough is generated -- the entropy sources that can supply entropy on demand shall support being polled by the subsystem - means for the user to query the subssystem for N bytes of entropy -- to be resolved : support source hoping ? or will be adding from multiple SW and HW sources enough ? - sources -- HW sources from SoC , drivers for entropy/crypto specific modules -- SW sources : --- drivers that have soft/random timings --- IRQ handler timings --- network noise The current subsystem implementation ( drivers/random ) is not sufficient as it allows only a single source of entropy to be used . More solid entropy could be achieved by adding push points , reinforced with HW generated one . ( Imported from Jira ZEP-1314 )  	0	1

Describe the bug Hi , I tried to gest started with the zephyr mesh examples on my custom board ( < URL > that is based on an E73-2G4M04S1B module ( nrf52832 qfaa ) . I tested my custom bluetooth board before using fruitymesh , an other nrf52 mesh software that is based on nordics soft device that worked fine . I used the nrf52dk_nrf5832 as zephyr board , I did not change anything on the nrf52dk_nrf5832 its for testing . After testing the Blinky example that worked fine I wanted to try the mesh examples . I used the examples samples/boards/nrf/mesh/onoff_level_lighting_vnd_app and samples/bluetooth/mesh_demo to get started . Building and flashing worked fine with the lates zephyr 2.30 on ubuntu with nrfjprog and jlink . To Reproduce I followed the instructions from < URL > and < URL > Expected behavior I was not able to get any sign of live from the device . I was not able to get communication on uart ( not sure if this is enabled in this examples ) but I also could not detect the device over bluetooth . Environment ( please complete the following information ): - OS Ubuntu 18.02 - Toolchain latest sdk and lates Zephyr I have no Idea what step I am missing . I appreciate any tip . I am new to zephyr and really want to get the mesh demo running before I make further investigations on how to use zephyr for my application . Thanks for any help . Best regards , Nils	2	0

In addition to suspend and resume , devices would also need to be set to other power states e.g. a state in which the peripherals can be clock gated . To achieve this , the following needs to be done . Define new device power states Update the device PM API - create a function that can be used to set the different device PM states .

Describe the bug In the Encryption Start Procedure , for the case when the host does not provide an LTK , the controller is supposed to send an LL_ENC_RSP before sending LL_REJECT_IND or LL_REJECT_EXT_IND . To Reproduce 1 . Modify hci_core . c , : le_ltk_request () . to always call : le_ltk_neg_reply () . : : // if ( bt_smp_request_ltk(conn , evt -> rand , evt -> ediv , ltk )) { // le_ltk_reply(handle , ltk ); // } else { le_ltk_neg_reply(handle ); // } . Build the peripheral_hr sample Connect and try bonding , expect it to fail . Observe the sniffer log . Expected behavior Send LL_ENC_RSP before LL_REJECT_IND . See the MSC in Bluetooth Core Specification v 5.1 , Vol 6 , Part D , Section 6.7 , or Part B Section 5.1.3.1 . If encryption is not supported by the Link Layer of the slave , the Link Layer of the slave shall send an LL_REJECT_IND or LL_REJECT_EXT_IND PDU with the ErrorCode set to Unsupported Remote Feature / Unsupported LMP Feature ( 0x1A ) . 鈥?The Link Layer of the slave shall then send an LL_ENC_RSP PDU . The Link Layer of the slave shall then notify the Host with the Rand and EDIV fields . Impact Possible showstopper . Peer devices may cache that the controller does not support encryption , thereby leaving the link unencrypted .

If you type : select . you can still use the : tab . button to prompt and autocomplete all available commands . To unselect the command one must press : ctrl + s . .

Reported by Hirally Santiago : We have parallel implementations of some interrupt and swap code in arch/x86/core/i386_sysV_abi and iamcu_abi . The iamcu versions are written in C and are easier to understand/maintain . It would be nice if we can use the C version in both ABIs , and not have to maintain two different implementations ; once execution flow transitions from assembly to C domain they should be the same . However , at the end of the day what we would like to have is just one implementation ( either C or ASM ) that is #ifdefed instead of 2 completely parallel implementations .

This is true for read , write and erase calls but not for : flash_get_page_info_by_offs . call which uses offset in relation to the flash begin address . Origin of the bug : The flash shim API `struct flash_driver_api ' allows to get flash layout in shape of run-length encoded description .

Some types of exceptions ignore interrupt locking : machine checks , non-maskable interrupts , double faults . These currently all go through the exception handling path on x86_64 . In these cases , if they happen at the wrong time , the check to determine whether we need to swapgs and/or update page tables may not be correct . This can happen in between when the CPU pushes the code segment onto the stack , and the swapgs operation is performed at interrupt/exception/syscall entry ( or the reverse on the way out ) . The right thing to do in this case is a more expensive operation to read the GS_BASE MSR and figure out if it's already set to the TSS for the current CPU . We'd need an alternate exception entry point for this as other exceptions don't have this problem .	2	1

I would like to be able to write a single devicetree bindings file that allows multiple compatibles to match it . This will allow me to write a single binding for a single compatible family of devices made by multiple vendors . My particular use case is WS2812 and SK6812 LED controllers , so I want to be able to write : : compatible : [' worldsemi , ws2812-spi ' , ' szledcolor , sk6812-spi ' ] . Describe the solution you'd like The above should match devicetree nodes with either of the compatibles in the list . Describe alternatives you've considered I could write multiple bindings files that each have their own compatible and include a common one . This feels inelegant and repetitive , however .
