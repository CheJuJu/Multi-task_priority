Reported by Johan Hedberg : Currently the H : 4 driver ( drivers/bluetooth/hci/h4 . c ) reads all its data in ISR context , which means that if there is no higher-level flow control it may be forced to drop data when there are no buffers available . To avoid this , the ISR should only do minimal processing and defer the UART reading to a separate thread that's able to block while waiting for buffers to be available . As the reading of the UART wouldn't happen immediately after an RX interrupt it means the UART HW flow control should kick in and prevent the controller from writing data to the UART until the host-side is actually ready to process it .

Right now , it's rather hard to repurpose the memory used by the main thread's stack after initialization . The obvious options are either to implement your own work queue , or write a pile of hacks to find the main stack , wait until the main thread has exited , and then spawn a work queue there . ( The specific use case I have is to have a work queue that runs extremely-low priority work , so I can't use the system work queue , and I'm running out of memory and I have some stack-heavy initialization , which is why I want to run it on the main thread ) Describe the solution you'd like Add a function that starts a work queue on the thread that it's called upon : : extern void k_work_q_run(struct k_work_q * work_q ) . Caveats The reason that this is a bug and not a 3 line pull request is that it doesn't seem obvious to me that there's a good way to synchronize between something that wants to submit to the main thread's work queue and the main thread actually getting far enough to initialize the work queue . This seems to be a more general problem , though : e.g. < URL > which initializes a delayed_work in main , but submits it in a callback which might be called before main finishes ? Perhaps , instead of providing functionality to turn the main thread into a work queue , the main thread should always be a work queue , and the application's main being just a work item submitted to it ?	2	1

Instead , they respectively correspond to the PCI-e bus device function and ID values . See soc/x86/apollo_lake/soc . c to see what I mean , note how : device_mmu_region () . is used . This is not ideal as we are overloading information . One would expect these macros to always return a pointer and a size_t , and not a pcie_bdf_t/pcie_id_t pair in some cases but not others .

Right now the SMP implementation has an idle loop for auxiliary CPUs that simply spins on the scheduler waiting for a runnable thread to appear . That minimizes latency at the expense of power ( the opposite tradeoff would be to wait for our next timer tick , but that can be a very long time ) . A proper architecture would have the scheduler issue an inter-processor interrupt to idle CPUs whenever a thread was added to the ready queue so that they can synchronously wake up . ( Even this might require some performance tuning in the long term , though , because in many cases the thread is being added just as the current thread is being removed and we don't want to incur the wakeup costs ) .	1	1

Describe the bug A recently introduced Kconfig option , BOARDS_ENABLE_CPUNET controls whether remoteproc_mgr_boot () is called from nrf5340 Application MCU booting process . remoteproc_mgr_boot () should be ideally called only once , and by the image that resets the nrf5340 NETWORK MCU . So BOARDS_ENABLE_CPUNET should be set by the image that cooperates with the NETWORK MCU . If this is a Non-Secure image , then parts of the configuration done in remoteproc_mgr_config () are never executed , and this is a problem . If , instead , we allow BOARDS_ENABLE_CPUNET to be enabled from both Secure and Non-Secure Application MCU images , then the RESET of NET MCU is occurring twice , which is very confusing . We also do not deal with ( extreme ) corner cases when the image responsible to reset the NET MCU does not own the shared memory .

Reported by Jon Medhurst : I've spent many days chasing a Heisenbug occurring on an ARM Cortex M3 device that started with the switch to the unified kernel . I've tracked this down to a seemingly stale value of preempReg . psp when fiberRtnValueSet is called from sem_give_common during an ISR . The dodgy value of preempReg . psp points to several call levels up the process stack , so fiberRtnValueSet writing zero there has a delayed and varying effect depending on timing and memory layout . I believe there is a race condition with k_sem_take and possibly other kernel functions , like this ... k_sem_take will : - disable interrupts - move current thread to semaphore wait_q - call _Swap _Swap issues ' svc # 0 ' which calls __svc __svc will : - enable interrupts - trigger __pendsv ( I'm a bit vague on this ) __pendsv will : - save register context including PSP into the thread struct If an interrupt occurs between __svc enabling them and __pendsv saving PSP , then the interrupt's ISR when it calls k_sem_give will go wrong as it : - sees the thread in the semaphore wait_q - removes it - makes it ready - calls _se t_t hread_return_value ( fiberRtnValueSet ) - fiberRtnValueSet looks at the thread's saved PSP to poke the value PSP hasn't yet been updated by __pendsv so it's a stale value from the previous context switch , resulting in unpredicable word on the stack getting set to zero .

If CONFIG_SWITCH is enabled , the initial context switch into the main thread ( either in prepare_multithreading () or smp_ini t_t op () has a fundamental flaw . It's relying on a partially initialized ' dummy_thread ' for the outgoing thread information , with dummy_thread -> switch_handle being NULL . This causes a NULL pointer dereference to any arch that uses the outgoing switch handle for anything . When I enable memory protection this causes a fatal page fault on intel64 . Some solutions I've considered : 1 . Add a NULL check in the arch switch code for the outgoing thread handle ( slow ) 2 . Implement CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_CUSTOM_SWAP_TO_MAIN instead of a dummy thread , which would be mandatory for all arches implementing CONFIG_SWITCH , and there is no support for this yet in smp_ini t_t op () 3 . Change switch handles to be something typed ( like the actual thread objects ) so that dummy thread switch handles can be populated in kernel code in an arch-agnostic way To me option 3 seems preferable Impact : All arches using CONFIG_SWITCH () are de-referencing a null pointer , silently unseen until now due to luck and no SMP arches having memory protection enabled .  	0	0

This will cause ticker operations on the previosly expired node ( expected ) , but in some cases increment lazy_current , even though the node was not sceduled to execute via the req/ack mechanism . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : 1 . One or more BLE connections and advertising active ( multiple BLE connections with same conn . interval helps trigger issue ) 2 . Observe BLE connection integrity 3 . Peripheral may be disconnected or stop receiving packets for long periods at a time Expected behavior All BLE connections must be maintained according to the standard . Impact Peripheral may be disconnected with MIC error on peer side , or - depending on supervision timeout - stop receiving packets for long periods at a time , with suddenly one packet received followed by no packets . This is due to event counter getting out of sync , and thereby in most cases calculate a wrong channel .

On a XIP system , text/rodata are on flash and all read-write memory are on SRAM . It's trivial to define MPU regions for each with appropriate permissions . On a non-XIP system , text , rodata , and data are all in SRAM . We need the capability to configure a power-of-two sized subsection , starting at the lowest SRAM addresses , for text/rodata , and then pad this out so that data starts at the end of this region . The size of memory reserved for text/rodata should be a configuration option ( OK but not great solution ) , or somehow automatically derived ( much better solution ) . Since all power-of-two MPUs we have encountered to date support prioritized overlapping regions , we would have region definitions : A lowest priority static region covering all of SRAM with supervisor read-write , no execute permissions A higher-priority static region covering the first X bytes of memory with read-only , execute permissions , where X is some power of two which can fit all the text/rodata within it . : | ------------------------ SRAM REGION ( rw ) ------------------------- | | -------- ROM REGION ( rx ) -------- | Then in the linker , pad out the beginning of the data section : | -- text --|-- rodata --|-- padding --|-- data sections ----|-- unused RAM -- | .

The following was discovered in testing and development of #22659 : In the old GPIO API interrupt configuration was integrated with pin configuration , so an interrupt could be enabled with : : gpio_pin_configure(dev , PIN_IN , GPIO_DIR_IN | GPIO_INT | GPIO_INT_LEVEL ); . and disabled within the callback with the idiom : : gpio_pin_configure(dev , PIN_IN , GPIO_DIR_IN ); . which , because it did not include any interrupt-related flags , was interpreted to mean disable interrupts . In the new API interrupt configuration is done with the : gpio_pin_interrupt_configure () . function . The disable flag is a non-zero value distinct from the non-zero enable flag . For legacy compatibility : gpio_pin_configure () . extracts interrupt-related flags from its flags parameter and invokes : gpio_pin_interrupt_configure () . with them , which means the legacy enable command works . However , the legacy disable command has no interrupt-related flags , which means the new implementation of : gio_pin_configure () . leaves interrupts enabled . In the case of level-triggered interrupts where the legacy disable operation is invoked in the callback the application will hang unless : GPIO_INT_DISABLE . is added to the flags .	2	2

Commit ef3c5e551676278ccc1f42ecb572838144c5e33a changed the way WES T_T OPDIR is initialized from calling ' west topdir ' as a subprocess to using the west API . However , WES T_T OPDIR is a cmake variable and must be a cmake-style path , with forward slashes . While ' west topdir ' as a command does output a forward slash separated path ( basically in order to make the zephyr build system work ) , wes t_t opdir () as an API returns the path in the host environment path style , which on Windows uses backslashes . This turns out to be the ultimate cause of the following build error : : CMake Error at C :/ ... /CheckCCompilerFlag . cmake : 41 ( set ): Syntax error in cmake code when parsing string -fmacro-prefix-map = C : /Users/Marti/zp = WES T_T OPDIR . Fix it by converting to POSIX style in Python . We could have potentially also done this using file(TO_CMAKE_PATH ' ${WES T_T OPDIR }' ... ) , but I'm intentionally repeating the old way of doing things since it was known to work .

Reported by Benjamin Walsh : A potpurri of memory map-related enhancements : Change ' number of blocks used ' API to ' number of blocks free ' API , since the latter is more useful . ( Or else support both ? ) Allow users to specify alignment of memory map blocks . ( Requires an extra argument during initialization . ) Need to decide how to handle cases where alignment would cause a gap between blocks . ( Do we allow this or force the user to ensure that block size is a multiple of alignment ? ) Note that minimum permitted alignment is word-aligned , since kernel uses first word of each block as a pointer when the block is part of the free list . Revise memory map APIs to use k_mem_block type , just like memory pools do . makes it possible for mailbox to handle blocks from either a memory pool or a memory map improves consistency of use for application designers ( can more easily switch code from map to pool ) mailbox can distinguish between block types because memory map blocks will specify a size of 0 , rather than the actual block size ( as with memory pools ) might have a legacy issue in that applications are passing in a 1 field structure , rather than a 4 field structure -- not sure if we can easily work around this ... ( maybe take the approach that the new APIs use the new structure , but mailboxes can't support memory map blocks until the legacy APIs are removed ? ) ( Imported from Jira ZEP-927 )  	0	1

Fixes #13783 The aim of this PR is to reduce the run-time stack usage when re-programming the ARM MPU during context-switch and/or arm-user-mode-enter . What it does is to change how the configuration is passed from : arm_core_mpu . c . to the HW-specific MPU drivers ( ARMv7 , ARMv8 , and NXP MPU ): Instead of creating the complete desired memory map online and supplying it to the drivers as an arrray of k_mem_partition objects , we , now , only create an array of pointers to k_mem_partition_object and supply that to the drivers . Reduction to stack usage is observed , mainly , when CONFIG_USERSPACE is set : this is because the mem-domain partition information is kept in kernel globals and we just supply pointers to the mem-domain partitions . In builds without USERSPACE support there is practically no stack usage reduction , as the only dynamic region could be the the MPU guard , and that one is still generated online . However , since this is the only dynamic region , the stack usage is not a problem in this scenario .	1	0

Reported by Inaky Perez-Gonzalez : As a developer , I want to be able to switch on and off different parts of the code at build time , but at the same time , maximize the code coverage of compiles to avoid bit rot . Currently a lot of #ifdef sections are used , which cause hardship in validation of the validity of code ( eg : when an API is changed in somefile . h that is used in anotherfile . c , but that usage is only enabled when CONFIG_OPTION_X is enabled ) . Although the solution ' test with CONFIG_OPTION_X enabled ' is the obvious and correct answer , it quickly becomes apparent it does not scale when the number of config options and combinations skyrocket . We have been working on some proposals to handle these cases , which enable the code to be compiled all the time and reduces the exposure of #ifdefs to way smaller corners of the code that will actually have the compile determine if the compiled code has to be optimized out ( and thus there is no code size impact ) or kept . This task is to track the implementation of the generic frameworks for doing so across different drivers and subsystems .

Reported by Andrew Boie : I needed to implement some arch-specific inline functions to handle direct interrupts . The most logical place to put this implementation would be in include/arch/*/arc h.h. However , these functions need to manipulate or read the kernel data structures defined in kernel/include/kernel_struct s.h. However this header pulls in kernel . h , which pulls in arch/cpu . h , leading to a circular dependency . Find a way for arches to define some inline functions , that automatically get pulled in when arch . h is included , such that these inline functions may reference _kernel , _current , etc .

The default sys_fatal_error_handler decides to hang the system or recover by killing the offending task and continue . For stack checking errors , the behavior is not consistent over different architectures , there is an #ifdef that enables the hang for stack errors , but conditions for the #ifdef are different . Bit strange since the error that is triggered is in all cases the same . My recommendation would be to stick with the conservative ' hang ' behavior for all stack errors independent of the cause ( sentinel , canary , hw bounds check , MPU , ... ) , and change tests to overrule the default handler . Some tests currently expect the default handler to recover instead of hang ( see issue #8032 )	1	1

Describe the bug If we are in the middle of sending ISO data on an iso channel ( i.e. we have sent data , but have not yet received the num completed packets ) when an ISO ( or an ACL ) disconnects ( i.e. we get a disconnect complete event from the controller ) , we see the following fail : : conn = bt_conn_lookup_handle(handle ); if ( ! conn ) { BT_ERR('No connection for handle %u ' , handle ); continue ; } . There's nothing stopping us from deallocating iso channels while there is an ongoing write . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : 1 . Create ACL and CIS connection between two devices with a low ISO interval 2 . Reset or move one of the device out of range to trigger a disconnect 3 . See the error in the log Expected behavior The expected behavior would be to set the iso channels in the : BT_ISO_DISCONNECT . state until we have received the num complete packet of a pending write , and then release/deallocate the iso channel .

This is yet another item specific to samples and test cases that wrongfully being used and documented for every application .

Fix central role event prepare to demux and enqueue two Tx buffers so that MD bit can be set correctly . Add force MD bit feature wherein connection events can be extended to match the rate at which applications provide new Tx data . MD bit in Tx PDUs is forced on if there has been CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_BUFFERS count number times Tx/Rx happened in a connection event . The assumption here is , if controller's tx buffers are full , it is probable that the application would send more Tx data during the connection event , and keeping the connection event alive will help improve overall throughput .

Reported by Gajinder Vij : As a Zephyr developer , I would like the kernel to support tickless operation so that my application performs more optimally and has more deterministic performance . Breakdown . Change timers to always program in one-shot mode - start with HPET for a QMSI POC and then follow with loapic timer for x86 . Update other archs after full implementation is completed . - Program timer only if same priority task is present . If not , program to max cycles . - ticks will be replaced by ' time_slice_interval ' which will hold ms - Upon expiry do similar operations done currently for tickless idle i.e. calculate elapsed time and handle time-slicing and timeouts . - elapsed time will be maintained in ms or us - tick_announce will be replaced by elapsed_time_announce passing ms or us Change timeout management to use ms/us instead of ticks - Time granurality can be configured to use mili seconds or micro seconds . - _add_thread_timeout and below would use ms/us instead of ticks - structures , functions and tracking of time should be in ms/us - API with time parameter will use MS except _sys_soc_suspend which will be ms or us .

I have a high prio task ( the highest prio in the system , higher than anything else ) that should run every 20ms , to check that I toggle a LED that I measure with a scope . At random intervals ( sometimes every second , but sometimes it takes 15 seconds , or sometimes twice in a row ) it does not wake up after 20 ms but after 100ms ( it always seems to be 100ms ) . This system is not halted at that time , IRQ handlers do run just that all waits seem delayed 100ms . When I disable tickless ( : CONFIG_TICKLESS_KERNEL = n CONFIG_TICKLESS_IDLE = n . ) the problem goes away , and the task always ( tested several hours ) starts after 20ms . The task is scheduled like follows ; : K_TIMER_DEFINE(t , NULL , NULL ); void task(void * a ) { k_timer_start(&t , K_MSEC(20 ) , K_MSEC(20 )); while ( 1 ) { k_timer_status_sync(&t ); led_on (); .... led_off (); } } .	1	0

Reported by Allan Stephens : Currently the kernel maintains a linked list of active timeouts , with each timeout recording the number of additional ticks it must wait after the preceding timeout expires . It may be more efficient for a timeout to record the absolute tick count when it expires , rather than a delta . Potential benefits : * k_timer_remaining_get () would no longer need to walk the list to compute how much time is left until a timer expires -- it could just subtract the current tick count from the deadline tick count . * It should be slightly faster to handle the removal of a timeout that is stopped before it expires , since it wouldn't be necessary to adjust the delta time of the next timeout in the list ( if one exists ) . Potential costs : * Unknown . It might be worth prototyping the change and seeing if it increases footprint significantly -- if so , the time vs . space trade-off would need to be analyzed .

The implementation of : clock_gettime () . when called with : CLOCK_MONOTONIC . is non-monotonic ( it jumps backward ) about once a second after the first time that the k_cycle_get_32 () counter wraps . On the FRDM-K64F , this means the result is incorrect after about 35 seconds , and is never correct from then on . The problem is that the : k_cycle_get_32 () . is used mod : sys_clock_hw_cycles_per_sec . . Unless the hw cycles per sec is a power of two , the overflow will not occur on a second boundary . This effectively means that this sub-second value is completely meaningless after the counter wraps the first time . I can suggest two solutions , a shor t-t erm and a better fix : Use the lower precision ' ms ' value from `k_uptime_get () to set the nanosecond field . The value will be less ' accurate ' , but a less accurate number is still more useful than a completely meaningless value that is currently used . Longer term , keep a proper 64-bit counter by watching the k_cycle_get_32 counter , noticing overflows , and using them to increment an upper-32-bit counter . It might be best to just have a : k_cycle_get_64 () . counter , and use that for the monotonic time .	1	0

NVS has support for handling write alignment , by ' padding ' the header and data up to the write alignment . However the implementation has some issues : - When writing a header or a footer , some garbage might be written to the flash : : struct _nvs_data_hdr data_hdr ; ... hdr_len = _nvs_len_in_flash(fs , sizeof(struct _nvs_data_hdr )); ... rc = nvs_flash_write(fs , fs -> write_location , & data_hdr , hdr_len ); . : data_hdr . takes 4 bytes in memory , but : write-align . bytes are written to the flash . The remaining bytes are taken from the stack . - The same issue happens when reading the header or a footer , except that this time it causes stack corruption and thus non-predictable behavior : : hdr_addr = _nvs_head_addr_in_flash(fs , entry ); hdr_len = _nvs_len_in_flash(fs , sizeof(struct _nvs_data_hdr )); rc = nvs_flash_read(fs , hdr_addr , & head , hdr_len ); . On the other hand no padding is done when writing the data . This means that for a 4-byte value , when : write-align . equals to 8 bytes , only 4 bytes ends-up being passed to flash_write and the write get rejected by the flash layer . A quick workaround for the two first issues is to pad the structures in : nvs_priv . h . . For example with : write-align . set to 8 : : --- a/subsys/fs/nvs/nvs_priv . h +++ b/subsys/fs/nvs/nvs_priv . h @@ -47 , 11 +47 , 13 @@ struct _nvs_sector_hdr { struct _nvs_data_hdr { u16_t id ; u16_t len ; + u32_t _pad ; }; struct _nvs_data_slt { u16_t crc16 ; u16_t _pad ; + u32_t _pad2 ; }; .	1	0

When calling listen on a socket you are supposed to provide the length of the pending connections backlog . In Zephyr this parameter is ignored when reaching net_context_listen . Listen man entry specifies the behaviour as such : The backlog argument defines the maximum length to which the queue of pending connections for sockfd may grow . If a connection request arrives when the queue is full , the client may receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED or , if the underlying protocol supports retransmission , the request may be ignored so that a later reattempt at connection succeeds . Currently the behaviour seems to be largely driven by the value of CONFIG_NET_MAX_CONN .	2	1

This leads to idle not working as intended ( being constantly woken up by rtc interrupt ) and very high current consumption . < URL > : MAX_CYCLES . should be used instead of : MAX_TICKS . . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : 1 . Make system go to idle . There should be no timeout set . 2 . This will make system set timeout on the max value . This is passed to rtc driver and capped to the max value there . When comparator is set there is one more check to verify if rtc is not due already . Since wrong macro is used the rtc will trigger interrupt almost instantly . 3 . Observe idle thread looping and high power consumption . Expected behavior rtc should trigger with right timeouts .

Reported by Jukka Rissanen : The network sample applications in samples/net/* do the network setup each a bit differently although most of them need similar kind of setup . This leads to overly complex setup in these applications and also can introduce bad habits to out-of-tree applications if they follow how the initialization/setup is done in those sample apps .

So for ex . : : cmake .. /samples/hello_world/ -DBOARD = native_posix -GNinja -DCONFIG_NATIVE_POSIX_SLOWDOWN_TO_REAL_TIME = y . works as expected , while : cmake .. /samples/hello_world/ -DBOARD = native_posix -GNinja -DCONFIG_NATIVE_POSIX_SLOWDOWN_TO_REAL_TIME = n . will not dump the option in CMakeCache . txt , and when calling ninja , cmake will be rerun , and the . config file will be regenerated , forgetting the selection .

There are some I2C devices like tsm12 and eeprom . The power consumption is 200ua when the I2C buses of the nrf52832 is enabled , but without data transfering . But when data transfer throw the I2C bus , the power consumption of the board increased by about 400ua . The power consumption will never fall back again , even when the data transfering is over . What have you tried to diagnose or workaround this issue ? 1 . When the issue is taking place , i have tried to disconnect the physical connection of all the i2c devices included the tsm12 and the eeprom . But it is useless . So the increase of the power consumption issue is caused by the chip of nrf52832 . 2 . But the i2c driver of nrf52832 has disabled the i2c bus after data transfering by calling this function : ' nrfx_twim_disable(&get_dev_config(dev ) -> twim ); ' . So it seems that the power consumption issue is not caused by the i2c bus of the nrf52832 . 3 . Then i tried to disable all the interupts of the i2c bus of the nrf52832 . The issue does not take place . 4 . I tried to delete the calling of the function : k_sem_take(&(get_dev_data(dev ) -> completion_sync ) , I2C_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT_MSEC ) . The issue does not take place . 5 . So it seems that the interupts conflict with this function锛歬_sem_take . Maybe the interupts affect the power saving strategy of the kernel . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : 1 . Find a nrf52 based board with some i2c devices 2 . run the sample 3 . Test the power cosumpertion 4 . A nrf52832 based board without a i2c device is also can be used to reproduce the issue . Becase the errors can also trigger an interupt .	2	0

Describe the bug I am build a BLE central which scans for a custom BLE peripheral with it's own custom services and characteristics . The central scans for peripherals , scans their services and return their characterstic handles . The identification is done with 128bit UUIDs . bt_gatt_discover () returns the handle which are offset by -1 . E.g. The characteristic has the handle 0x20 but the returned handle is 0x19 . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : 1 . Modify a central sample ( e.g. Central-HR ) with custom UUIDs instead of Hearttrate service . 2 . Observe console output of returned attribute handles in discover_func () , 3 . Compare with the actual handle ( e.g. using nRF Connect Desktop ) .

Describe alternatives you've considered I've considered simply not supporting usermode . I have also looked at the memory domain API as a possible way to create shared memory , it seems plausible .

If a user picks a particular board , they shouldn't be able to change X in e.g. : menuconfig . , so X has no : prompt . . Since X has no prompt , it can't be assigned its board-specific value via a : . config . ( : *_defconfig . in this case ) file .

Reported by Flavio Santes : Use case : In order to ' activate ' the IP stack in TCP client mode , something must be sent by using the net_send function . In TCP mode , sending ' 0 ' bytes works . However , in UDP client mode sending ' 0 ' bytes breaks internally something in the IP stack , so this error appears . In UDP client mode , with the described conditions , after sending 0 bytes and receiving some data from the server , ip_buf_appdatalen returns wrong values . Justification : For some IoT protocols the client must wait until the server sends some data . If the client sends something before the server , the server closes the connection . The described scenario only applies to TCP but in the netz API we were trying to reuse our code-base . So , by doing that , this issue was discovered . Main concern here is related to validations inside the UDP code that may alter the stack behavior .

Describe the bug I'm using the Zephyr HCI UART sample on an PCA10040 board as a HCI controller . As HCI host I've written an application on Windows that communicates over the HCI UART with the PCA10040 board and acts as a BLE host . When a BLE peripehral is connected and data length extentions are activated ( MTU => 251 bytes ) sent ACL data packets with size of 251 bytes are not confirmed . If only 250 bytes are sent the confirmation is received by getting an HCI event ' Number Of Completed Packets Event ' . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : 1 . Modify the configuration for the HCI UART sample with the following values : BT_RX_BUF_LEN = 260 BT_CTLR_TX_BUFFER_SIZE = 251 BT_CTLR_DATA_LENGTH_MAX = 251 Screenshot of the configuration and a . config file is attached . < URL > Create Bluetooth Low Energy connection to a peripheral with DLE support for 251 bytes . Trigger data length update to enhance the MTU to 251 bytes . Send ACL data with a length of 250 bytes ( e.g. an ATT write command with 243bytes data . The sent ACL data is confirmed by a ' Number Of Completed Packets Event ' HCI event . Send ACL data with a length of 251 bytes ( e.g. an ATT write command with 244bytes data . The sent ACL data is NOT confirmed by a ' Number Of Completed Packets Event ' HCI event . Expected behavior It is expected that the HCI UART device sends back an ' Number Of Completed Packets Event ' HCI event after sending the data to the peer device .

Reported by Quanwen Du : The suggestions here : 1 . For : mem_slab . , current logic is using the first 4bytes of the free buffer as NEXT pointer of free_list , then link all the free buffers together . But I suggest to use the tail 4bytes as NEXT pointer of free_list . As we know there are issues of memory overflow/corruption . If we move the NEXT to the tail 4bytes , then we have a bigger guard space , then even when memory overflow writing happens , it is lower possibility that the NEXT pointer will be corrupted . I know there is argument that we should let the corruption be visible earlier , but I think it shall be always right to reduce the impact of the overflow corruption 2 . There is similar suggestion for : mem_pool . , which puts the bitmap and level info at the end of the buffer . So the suggestion here is to change : K_MEM_POOL_DEFINE . : to move : _mpool_lvls_# #name . before : mpool_buf_# #name . ; also to define the bitmap of block availability before _mpool_buf # #name . Of cause this suggestion assumed the toolchain will layout these arrays per its definition sequence , I will assume this is the most case , so shall be OK to re-layout these arrays .

Reported by Andrew Boie : We need a good method for defining stack memory regions . Right now the typical way to do it is with __stack __noinit . We may need something more generic so that we can have fine , architecture-specific control on how the stacks are declared . For example , on x86 all the stacks are going to need to be aligned to 4096 byte boundaries , AND any given stack area should be immediately preceded by some memory which cannot be written to by the current thread . So I think we will need to position all the stacks in between rodata ( which can't be written to ) and the data section . Other arches have much less in the way of constraints on the alignment/size of stacks , but the general requirement is that if the thread attempts to write RAM immediately before the stack ( i.e. it overflows ) we get an exception .

Reported by Chuck Jordan : The following tests malfunction for ARC cpu targets : tests/benchmarks/boo t_t ime legacy/benchmark/boo t_t ime/ When CONFIG_BOO T_T IME_MEASUREMENT is defined , some very early initialization is supposed to assign the value __star t_t sc . This can't be done with ARC because _tsc_read is implemented to rely on tick interrupts , and that hasn't come alive during this early time . What could be done , is the ARC timer0 could be activated very early , w/o it causing an interrupt , just so that COUNT register increments . __star t_t sc could be initialized to zero early ( but after bss zeroed if this is in bss ) . Or perhaps just let the bss zeroing zero it . Then later , when the timer0 is to be activated for interrupts , to the necessary math to keep the COUNT up to that point as part of the TIME being maintained by the sys_clock . c implementation . In this way , 64-bit time , as returned by _tsc_read () , can be functional from very early init . ( Imported from Jira ZEP-1747 )	2	0

If you make a search in the Zephyr docs , like : < URL > You get results in unrendered ReST , which is kind of unreadable ( especially for headers ) . This is because the search looks in the sources directory which contains ReST files and outputs content directly from them . This can be worked around by producing text files instead .

If the remote device sends a burst of data that fills the TCP receive window , then reception halts until the remote sends a keep-alive . This reduces the peak receive throughput by > 10x . The sequence is : Zephyr advertises a receive window of 1280 bytes Remote sends one packet of 640 bytes Remote sends another packet of 640 bytes Zephyr acknowledges with a receive window of 0 bytes The Zephyr app reads the data Later , the remote sends a TCP keep-alive Zephyr acknowledges with a receive window of 1280 bytes The remote waits ~ 100 of ms before sending the keep-alive , which limits the throughput to ~ 12800 B/s . Ideally , if the window was full , then Zephyr would send a packet with the updated window once the app starts reading data .

This can lead to a deadlock . Consider that all TX packets/bufs were allocated ( can easily happen with patches like < URL > and that's why I'm arguing against it ) , but there's no ETH address known for some pkt , deadlock . prepare_arp_reply () , which is on RX path , likewise calls the above functions with K_FOREVER timeout . Not only that can lead to deadlock , such deadlock can be caused externally ( thus an easy road to DoS ) . I don't see any request timeout functionality present . I.e. , if ARP request was sent and no reply received , it won't be retried , and the pending payload packet can potentially sit in the queue infinitely long .  	0	0

Describe the bug Some dependencies have accumulated on the internal minimal libc function : z_prf () . , to the point where the function was moved out of minimal libc and into lib/os . This is not good , lib/os now has two completely orthogonal printf()-like implementations that we will have to maintain in perpetuity , even if minimal libc is not used , and especially if we ever settle on a different third-party small-footprint C library and remove minimal libc entirely . Any kernel subsystem dependency on : z_prf () . needs to use the : printk () . family of functions instead . If : printk () . needs to support some functionality that is only offered by : z_prf () . ( like printing floating point values ) add non-default Kconfigs against printk () code which adds this and has negligible footprint or stack space impact on users who don't enable it . : z_prf () . itself needs to be moved back to minimal libc where it belongs .  	0	0

Users should be able to describe complex applications that are organized into a hierarchy of libraries with different build properties . To this end , it must be documented and exemplified how to create and use new app CMake libraries . The desired model for application libraries is that they be organized as pure CMakeLists . txt libraries that could in theory be copied verbatim from a CMake project . So , no reliance on Zephyr CMake extensions or conventions . This is believed to lower the barrier of entry for application developers as they do not have to learn about Zephyr's CMake model and can instead use the standard CMake API to describe their application . But it is not clear how to achieve this goal . One problem relates to linking . In the zephyr model , libraries are -- whole-archive'd together to resolve unresolved references . But in the CMake model libraries should instead be explicitly linked together . There exists build script code that is aware of the ' app ' library and ensures that it is whole-archived , but there is no mechanism to ensure that extra application libraries are linked in ( and it is not clear if it desirable to use whole-archive on these libraries ) .	1	1

The init systemcall for the k_msg_q allows passing in a userspace buffer that is then written/read from the threads using the kernel object . If this buffer was to be relinquished for example because the userspace process released it from the heap or a stack frame unwound , subsequent reads/writes through the queue object would result in using the dangling pointer . The same holds for the put , get systemcalls that allow delayed writes/reads from the msg_q buffer ( through the base . swap_data ) . The issue here is that the current thread's permission to access pending_thread -> base . swap_data is not checked at the system call handler .	1	0

With addition of MDB runner ( see < URL > it's now possible to run Zephyr binaries on both ARC boards and nSIM simulator via MetaWare debugger . But while it works OK-ish ( see < URL > with manual execution and to some extent with : sanitycheck . script with simulated : nsim_* . targets , attempt to use : sanitycheck . script with ARC boards results on all failed tests . That's because MDB runner is based on : ZephyrBinaryRunner . ( see < URL > which listens on : stdout . of the spawned process . But in case of real board connected via UART we need to act more like OpenOCD runner listening on the specified serial port . Obviously there're 2 options on how to solve this : 1 . Restrict usage/disable MDB runner for real boards keeping it only for simulation ( especially : nsim_hs_smp . ) . 2 . Add missing back-end to the runner for connection to the serial port But looking forward with addition of MetaWare toolchain support ( see < URL > we'd like to have an ability to use MetaWare tools for everything ( both building and running ) w/o any extra tools , so having MDB runner capable of running Zephyr on real targets in : sanitycheck . could be a very nice addition .

Currently some object types , such as mailboxes , lock interrupts for the duration of some operations when they could get away with locking only the kernel thread scheduler ( because the object cannot be used by ISRs ) . The locking done by each kernel object type should be reviewed to ensure it is efficient .

Right now we do some special testing using babbelsim that is not available to users running sanitycheck locally . This can be disruptive when something fails in CI but can't be reproduced locally on the developer system . Add to that the fact that the setup of nrf52_bsim is not straightforward . We should make this available through to anyone running sanitycheck and we should be able to whatever happens in CI on any machine where development happens . We should look into pull the babbelsim code into the west manifest and make it available to sanitycheck in any local build and remove the special handling from the CI docker image .	1	1

According to the [ link spec| < URL > reading a value from this address means ( bitwise ): Read value 0 : pin driver is low Read value 1 : pin driver is high Write : writing a ' 1 ' sets the pin low ; writing a ' 0 ' has no effect This means when setting a single GPIO pin to low also sets all other pins to low that were previously high due to the |= operation performed .

The idea being that even if the _current thread is a high priority coop thread , we can still preempt it when it's pending , suspended , etc . This does not take into account if the thread is sleeping . k_sleep () merely removes the thread from the ready_q and calls Swap () . The scheduler will swap away from the thread temporarily and then on the next cycle get stuck to the sleeping thread for however long the sleep timeout is , doing exactly nothing because other functions like _ready_thread () use _is_thread_ready () as a check before proceeding .

With the merge of #30196 we need to convert any device object definitions that are based on a devicetree node to use : DEVICE_DT_DEFINE . instead of : : DEVICE_DEFINE . 17 driver source files : DEVICE_AND_API_INIT . 361 driver source files The vast majority of these are for devices that are associated with a devicetree node . Changing allows use of new API to access the device object directly via : DEVICE_DT_GET () . rather than a runtime lookup through the : label . property , and provides access to additional common devicetree information like dependencies . Examples of the sort of changes required include : * 63043bc5acc26f9a2203afaf58039d5dc86d11cd when instance macros based on iterating over devices are already used ; * cf339279338b0859ea1efc13a2806cb527fdc093 when interrupts require local direct access to the device before it is defined . There will be remaining instances of : DEVICE_DEFINE . and/or : DEVICE_AND_API_INIT . for device objects that do not derive from devicetree , such as USB class instance devices like : CDC_ACM . . Note The role of this issue is solely to replace the macros used to define : struct device . objects when a device corresponds to a devicetree node . It enables , but does not implement , changes in device references in driver from ones that use the : label . property . As noted in #30536 that can only be done when all drivers in a given subsystem have been converted .  	0	0

What happens is that 6lo compression modifies the IPv6 header as it needs to compress it . The same IPv6 header is used in TCP to verify if we received an ack and can release the saved net_buf . This verification will fail as the TCP sequence number is different location in the net_buf . The end result is that the device seems to run out of memory because the net_buf's are never removed as we never receive matching ack numbers from peer . This affects both 802.15.4 and Bluetooth . In Bluetooth there is extra problem that the net_buf meta data is modified because of BT segmentation . ( Imported from Jira ZEP-1719 )  	0	0

Providing a bare-bones reproducible example isn't easy in this case , but I can reproduce it reliably with customer code . It seems that when you suspend the UARTE and then resume it ( using : device_set_pm_state () . ) , there is a window right after resume in which transmissions get corrupted . This is the setup : pm hooks suspends UART and : cpu_idle () . timer interrupt triggers ; pm hooks resume UART , ISR pushes item to work queue work item TX : es eight bytes and RX : es eight bytes I have verified by oscilloscope that the bytes TXed are correct and the bytes RXed are correct on the serial line . However , when my application reads the RX bytes , they are garbled ( and an extra byte is added ) . This can be reproduced consistently , but only if the power management hooks suspending/resuming the UART are enabled . It can be worked around by adding a dummy RX prior to TXing , so it's not a high prio bug ( for me atleast :P ) but it's clearly indicative of something generating spurious events .	1	0

Reported by David Kinder : From the zephyr user mailing list : < URL > It would be nice if we could display a features support matrix on the Supported Boards pages , or on the wiki . Red / amber / green colouring of boxes is commonly used in such displays , and it's very effective in showing at a glance the state of support for each feature . This can help people make informed purchases and avoids unhappy surprises . I can echo Rohit's dismay at discovering that the level of support for FRDM-K64F features is currently sparse . For such a full-featured board produced by a founding Zephyr partner and listed as an officially Supported Board , this discovery wasn't expected . A feature matrix would be very helpful for end users who have just discovered Zephyr , and it could help focus the attention of developers on features that are in need of work too . This came about when a user ( Rohit ) asked , ' I'm having difficulty setting a UDP echo-server using samples/net/echo_server .... Is there any reason why uIP would not work on a K64F over Ethernet ? ' and the answer give was : There isn't an Ethernet driver for the FRDM-K64F yet . We do have a generic ( non-Zephyr ) Ethernet driver for this SOC in the Kinetis SDK , and have imported it into the Zephyr tree ( see ext/hal/ksdk/drivers/fsl_enet . *) , but we still need to hook it up to uIP .

In the different SPI drivers for each of the SoC's i noticed that there's no control mentioned over the peripheral own chip select line(s ) . Only in case a GPIO is used , the behavior is defined . Some chipset have multiple CS lines per peripheral . There is no interface given to map devices to each of the chipsets . secondly , the flag SPI_HOLD_ON_CS is only used for the gpio version in all drivers , but the CS is never cleared in the release call , so at least a transfer is needed to clear the chip-select . This could be problemantic . E.g. In case the output of the first transaction tells the higher level driver , there's no use to continue to communicate , there's no means to set the chip-select inactive without doing another SPI transfer . ( Most drivers simply skip the chip select and configuration step when the config pointer didn't change and/or there are no buffers supplied .	1	0

Reported by Carles Cufi : Currently the Nordic RTC hardware peripheral is used directly from 2 different subsystems : drivers/timer/nrf_rtc_timer ( System Timer ) subsys/bluetooth/controller/hal/nrf5/cntr . c Instead we should have a single base drivers/rtc/nrf_rtc . c that is the reused by the 2 subsystems above . Things to take into account : Should we expose a full RTC peripheral , or a single Capture-Compare register per driver instance ? Is the rtc . h API enough or does it need to be extended ? Should we instead target the counter . h API , which seems more adequate for a Real Time Counter ? Assumptions * The RTC functions can be called from any IRQ priority except potential zero-latency IRQ priorities if CONFIG_ZERO_LATENCY_IRQS is configured . * The RTC interrupt handler itself can be configured to run at any non-zero-latency IRQ priority . * set_alarm () function first reads current counter value . If ( alarm_value > = now ) alarm will be triggered in current 32 counter cycle , otherwise it will be set in far future . It means that setting very short alarm needs precautions or even irq_locking () for avoiding preemption . These precautions are not implement in the driver , they should be taken in code layer that uses the driver . ( Imported from Jira ZEP-1808 )	1	1

The POSIX subsystem injects a large number of standard headers into the include path to provide declarations required for POSIX when they may be missing in minimal libc . It currently uses detailed knowledge of underlying newlib and minimal libc private headers to re-use as much as possible . A similar problem has been solved for C++ by having Zephyr's minimal libc : stdint . h . use : #include_next < stdint . h > . to obtain material from the toolchain version while still enhancing the header contents for Zephyr-specific needs . This should be considered for the POSIX subsystem to reduce maintenance complexity . Relates to #13767 #17706	2	1

Reported by Paul Sokolovsky : With JerryScript/Zephyr port , which uses Zephyr shell API to get the input : : js > for ( var i = 0 ; i < 10000 ; i++) { a . push('foo ' ) ; } Too many parameters ( max 10 ) . Oops . And not much can be done here , because a level below the shell API is uart_register_input () with nano kernel fifo queues . I.e. you either get a nice generic callback-based shell API , but with argc/argv/MAX_NUM = 10 straightjacket , or need to do pretty low-level Zephyr-specific programming . It would be nice to solve it somehow on shell API level . For example , besides void shell_register_app_cmd_handler () , also have shell_register_app_line_handler () , which would receive original , unsplit char * line . Logic could be : on receiving a complete line , parse non-destructively a first word of it . If a word is matched against command array , parse line fully , call handler . Otherwise , if app_line_handler is set , pass lien verbatim to it . Otherwise , if app_cmd_handler is set , parse line , and feed argc/argv to the latter handler . Please let me know if this would make sense , I can prepare a patch . ( Imported from Jira ZEP-532 )	2	0

This was covered up by a hack in the app shared memory test , which had to disable the MPU in order to initialize application shared memory bss : : #if defined(CONFIG_ARC ) /* * appmem_init_app_memory will access all partitions * For CONFIG_ARC_MPU_VER = = 3 , these partitions are not added * into MPU now , so need to disable mpu first to do app_bss_zero () */ arc_core_mpu_disable (); appmem_init_app_memory (); arc_core_mpu_enable (); #else appmem_init_app_memory (); #endif . This is not correct . Supervisor mode ( the kernel ) needs free access to the entirety of system RAM , we are only using memory domains to control user mode access to memory . Please fix the ARC MPU ver 3 background map to allow supervisor mode access , so that the policy is the same for ARC MPU version 2 , ARM , and x86 .  	0	0

Reported by Biswanath Goswami : DELETE method on observable CoAP resource does not always send correct notification . Notifications are always of type Content ( 2.05 ) for observable resources . As per the RFC 7641 , behavior should be as follows , 鈥?A notification SHOULD have a 2.05 ( Content ) or 2.03 ( Valid ) response code . However , in the event that the state of a resource changes in a way that would cause a normal GET request at that time to return a non-2 . xx response ( for example , when the resource is deleted ) , the server SHOULD notify the client by sending a notification with an appropriate response code ( such as 4.04 Not Found ) and subsequently MUST remove the associated entry from the list of observers of the resource . 鈥?But 4.04 ( Not Found ) response code is never sent from observable resource .

A : k_busy_wait(20 ) . in driver code to wait for a reset to complete was proceeding in 13 us , causing a hardware failure . While investigating I discovered that for Nordic NRF51 k_busy_wait delays : 12.38 us for an argument of 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 15 , or 20 us 26 to 51 us for an argument of 50 us 54 to 57 us for an argument of 75 us 83 to 86 us for an argument of 100 us Further , for NRF52840 k_busy_wait delays : * 3.9 to 4.58 us for an argument of 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 15 , or 20 us * 18 to 31 us for an argument of 50 us * 61 us for an argument of 75 us * 89 to 91 us for an argument of 100 us Timings derived from a custom application with a GPIO toggle before and after the delay , duration measured with Saleae Logic Pro-8 . That really short delays take much longer than they should is unfortunate . That longer delays take shorter than they should is simply unacceptable . We must have a reliable usleep functionality to satisfy hardware timing requirements . I did find issue #6498 which was enlightening but did not provide a solution . Some improvement might be accomplished by fixing k_busy_wait to account for cycles lost to integer truncation , though a 10% error in a 100 us delay is difficult to understand . However , I'm fixing it another way in a PR to be submitted next .	1	0

With an offloaded socket driver that uses AT commands ( over UART ) , this blocking work item blocks the working of the UART driver , because that uses the work queue to process received frames . ( Or at least the Nordic UART driver , uart_nrfx_uart . ) Hence , the : connect () . call blocks the code that should unlock it . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : 1 . Nordic chip ( maybe others as well ) 2 . Offloaded socket driver with modem that use AT commands over UART 3 . Use LwM2M 4 . Set Package URI in 5/0/1 resource Expected behavior Successful block-wise coap download of firmware binary from server . Impact Firmware pulls do not work when using this setup . Possible solutions - Use a direct call to the : firmware_transfer () . function , but I guess this was considered and there was deliberately chosen to use the the work queue . - Use a dedicated work queue so that the system work queue is not held up . - Use non-blocking sockets . If we can decide on a solution , I would like to implement it , so this issue can be assigned to me !	2	0

We have ( among number of others ): : void _nano_sys_clock_tick_announce(s32_t ticks ); . Using s32_t here doesn't make sense , this function is ' announce ' to let know how many ticks elapsed since since previous announcement , which is always a non-negative value .

Likewise , delay can't really be negative .

Please describe . There is an ioctl-like interface used within the networking code . I say ioctl-like but it really isn't ioctl because these functions are truly variadic instead of 2 or 3 args with the third optional arg a void pointer , which is what traditional ioctl is . Ioctls are bad . This thread concisely explains from Linus Torvalds himself what the problems are : < URL > On top of all what is said there , using variadic functions directly clashes with MISRA coding guidelines : MISRA C : 2004 , 16.1 - Functions shall not be defined with a variable number of arguments . Right now , the way ioctl is used internally by networking all it does is defeat type safety . This stuff isn't even application-facing , it's part of a socket descriptor inheritance scheme . There are no advantages , you can implement object orientation in C without it . We can of course keep vtable-like abstractions in the kernel , but these APIs need to have proper prototypes , see the Zephyr driver model and how each subsystem defines its APIs as an example . Describe the solution you'd like Any use if ioctl () removed from the kernel with the exception of what's minimally needed for POSIX compatibility , and such code MUST be limited to lib/posix and nowhere else with clearly defined scope . No internal networking object orientation scheme should be using variadic functions anywhere , with the exception of very well-defined stuff like printk () . Given that ioctls by their very nature are non-portable I expect the list of ones we must support for the posix compat layer to be little to none .	1	1

Because __packed is used , this will may cause perms[CONFIG_MAX_THREAD_BYTES ] even char * name are not 4 bytes aligned . In usespace . c : void _thread_perms_set(struct _k_object * ko , struct k_thread * thread ) { int index = thread_index_get(thread ); if ( index ! = -1 ) { sys_bitfield_set_bit((mem_addr_t)&ko -> perms , index ); } } . sys_bitfield_set is used to set some bit to of perms However , for most arch in zephyr . an assumption of sys_bitfield_set is that the mem_addr_t addr should be 4 bytes/32 bit aligned . For the case perms , if arch supports unaligned mem access , no exception will be raised , but possible performance downgrade ; if arch does not support unaligned mem access or disable it , an exception will be raised . So , suggest to guarantee the access to struct _k_object's perms should be 4 bytes/32bit aligned . Or guarantee the start address of struct _k_object should be 4 bytes/32 bit aligned	1	0

Describe the bug I tried to enable console via UARTE on nrf52810 but SOC crashes at early stage . Quick investigation revealed two things . * First is that : uart_console_init . does not check if get binding returned anything and so crash occurs much later when console is actually used . * Second - get binding returns NULL even if device is present ... I checked that it is NULL as API is NULL . This is strange as API is statically added when device is defined ( see : drivers/serial/uart_nrfx_uarte . c . ) .

Reported by Chuck Jordan : The latency_measure benchmark is NOT measuring RIRQ or FIRQ interrupts . Rather , it uses irq_offload () to trigger an interrupt . But this isn't really an interrupt , its an EXCEPTION using the trap instruction . Exception handling is much SLOWER on the ARC , since software must save all the registers w/o hardware assist . To truly measure RIRQ and FIRQ , we could either re-work irq_offload so that it uses the AUX_IRQ_HINT register ( requiring some interrupt vector ) , OR , we could create an ARC-only version of this benchmark that is re-written to use AUX_IRQ_HINT from the test itself -- and not use irq_offload .

Describe the bug From what I can read it's ok to keep scanning enabled while using : bt_le_per_adv_sync_create . etc . By removing the : scan_disable () . in direction_finding_connectionless_rx sample scanning stops working after a while . The standard scan callback keeps reporting standard advertisements , but stops reporting devices sending periodic advertisments . I guess the extended scanning stops working , but normal continues . ( never getting in < URL > as : info -> interval . is always 0 . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : 1 . Use latest Zephyr direction_finding_connectionless_tx on one device 2 . Use latest Zephyr direction_finding_connectionless_rx on another device and commit out call to : scan_disable () . in : main . . Also comment out the large print in : scan_recv . to avoid to much spam in the logs . 3 . Power on the tag , wait for sync and IQ data , then reset the device . 4 . Re-do step 3 . a few times until the sending device will not be found anymore . Expected behavior Continuous scanning still reporting devices sending periodic advertisements until scan is stopped . Or that application get notfied somehow that scanning stopped . Impact Application ends up in an unknown state and quirky workarounds are necessary ( I assume restarting scanning will work , but have not tried it . If that does not work then impact is larger . Logs and console output In the log I added a print in : scan_recv . to show that scanning is still running , but no device advertising periodic are found . < URL > Environment ( please complete the following information ): - OS : Windows - Toolchain ( e . g Zephyr SDK , ... ) : Zephyr SDK - Commit SHA or Version used : 429d6cf055766d63add2a000ba81c522d2e24f77	2	0

Fixes : #23825 Today , BOARD , SOC , ARCH , DTS , KCONFIG , and TOOLCHAIN_ROOT can be specified by users or through other CMake files . It is not clear if relative paths are permitted and/or from where a relative path is constructed . Inside CMake , it is very easy to specify : ${ZEPHYR_BASE } . , : ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR } . , or similar , thus there is no reason to use relative path inside CMake , as it easy can lead to discussion on relative to what . For users manually invoking CMake using , : cmake ... < app-dir > . it is nice to have to possibility to specify a relative path . For this purpose , relative path are considered relative to the : APPLICATION_SOURCE_DIR . . This commit updates : - BOARD_ROOT - SOC_ROOT - ARCH_ROOT - DTS_ROOT - KCONFIG_ROOT - TOOLCHAIN_ROOT to allow paths relative to : APPLICATION_SOURCE_DIR . when specified with : -D < type > _ROOT = < relative-path > . To support consistent behavior a : zephyr_file () . extension command has been introduced . This commands examines a path list for relative paths , and convert relative paths provided with : -D < path > . into absolute paths , starting from : APPLICATION_SOURCE_DIR . .	2	2

2 2 1.2 1.0 1.2 1.0 1.35 1.5 1.0 1.0 1.2 10 1.0 1 1 3 25	Compiler flags added late in the build are not exported to external build systems . The current infrastructure for integrating with external build systems can cause flags to be omitted in a way that is confusing and inconvenient for build script developers . Today it works like this : CMakeLists . txt code is processed in a sequential manner . Different subsystems ( arch/ , zephyr/CMakeLists . txt , subsystems/ , ext/) can globally add flags to the build , and the zephyr_get_* API reads out this global list of flags when it is invoked to export flags to external build systems . For third party build systems that are integrated in the ' app ' CMakeLists . txt file this works fine , because the code in the ' app ' CMakeLists . txt that is placed after boilerplate . cmake is the last code to be executed and will therefore have access to all flags . For Zephyr components things are trickier . No matter how careful we are in ordering arch , ext , subsys , there will eventually arise a use-case where two different systems are both exporting flags to external build systems and also globally adding compiler flags .	2	0

Zephyr's Kconfig implementation diverges from Linux by prefering later defaults . This is a problem for several reasons : Problem description Zephyr can no longer rely on the existing Kconfig ecosystem for documentation . Everything in the Linux kernel's Kconfig documentation applies to Zephyr's Kconfig except that the documentation is wrong when it states that earlier defaults have precedence . The divergence must be implemented in Kconfig tools . Currently this is done with an out-of-tree patch on kconfiglib that is expensive to maintain . Readers already familiar with the original Kconfig language will read Zephyr Kconfig files incorrectly . The above two issues are resolvable without aligning with Linux , but this is not . Problem solutions The cleanest solution is simply to follow the Linux kernel's behaviour . But to do this it must be better understood why the divergence occured and what the alternatives for diverging were . @ulfalizer has already looked into this here ( < URL > so we have some idea of why the divergence occured , but our options for re-aligning are not well understood .	1	1

When Kconfig ran before DTC , we could : ifdef #CONFIG_SOME_SOC . in our application DT overlays , and apply generic configuration on a per-SoC basis . Now that DTC runs first , this is impossible . A solution was attempted in < URL > but apparently has been abandoned for LTS at the moment . This regression makes it much more difficult to write portable applications that need to do something on a per-SoC basis , as Zephyr now only supports bringing in DT overlays on a per-board basis . Since many boards share SoCs , this hurts application portability . One use case for SoC-level overlays is to place extra partitions not served by the default upstream per-board overlays , or override them entirely to suit application requirements . A mechanism should be provided to change the device tree overlay depending on the SoC , not just the board .  	0	0

As an outstanding exception , < URL > actually mentions that there's : OPENOCD_INTERFACE . envvar which can be controlled one aspect of OpenOCD functioning . Beyond that , there's absolutely no generic , board-independent documentation on OpenOCD in Zephyr .

Describe the bug The bug can be observed when the following conditions combine : - a test requiring a fixture - the test does not have harness : console or ztest - the test is called for hardware that does not have the fixture defined . Even though a test requires a fixture in its yaml , twister will get in an infinite loop waiting for the device to become ready . I think the logic in : handle () . ( line 689 in twisterlib.py ) is wrong : : while not self . device_is_available(self . instance ): logger . debug('Waiting for device {} to become available ' . format ( self.instance.platform.name )) time . sleep(1 ) . The function : device_is_available () . checks if the fixture exists in the device and returns False . Then the 1 sec sleep is applied and the check for the fixture repeats . This happens until the timeout termination . If the test defines harness as console or ztest then the test is skipped correctly . If none of these harnesses is used then we end up in the loop . I am not sure if it is a real error . I found it when I was trying to figure out why #31188 was not getting filtered ( now harness : ztest is added to the yamls in PR and fixture is skipped correctly ) .	2	0

Please describe . parse_syscalls . py has a naive algorithm : It very naively parses system call invocations . It can't handle argument type declarations which are arrays , or function pointers . It looks at headers without invoking the preprocessor . This causes every : __syscall . found to generate an 8-byte entry in the system call dispatch table , even if the syscall is unimplemented . This situation is handled gracefully at runtime if such a call is invoked , but space is wasted in the table . Another side effect of not invoking the preprocessor is that you can't conditionally define whether an API is a syscall , for example : : #ifdef FOO_NEEDS_THESE_SYSCALLS #define FOO_SYSCALL __syscall #else #define FOO_SYSCALL #endif FOO_SYSCALL foo_yourself(void ); . Hopelessly confuses it . Describe the solution you'd like 1 . The semantics of __syscall should work , from an end user perspective , like any other C token 2 . The full extent of the C language should be usable for syscall function protoypes . 3 . Unimplemented system calls don't take up room in the dispatch table/ Number 3 is what really annoys me . This is overall a low-priority issue though . I thought of something clever of using DWARF parsing to get the syscall metadata instead of parsing headers , but this has a chicken-egg problem in that the generated syscall headers need to be in place or nothing compiles .	2	1

Describe the bug Replicated with nrf52840 , revision We execute most of our things from workqueue thread via works . During the latest testing we found out that when there is a lot of normal works , delayed works are not scheduled for execution . Quick investigation shows that delayed work is never submitted to the workqueue until system has nothing else to do . I.e. when user stops generating hid events system finally gets time to check expired delayed works and submit them . Another quick look into the timeout shows that when problem happens : z_clock_announce . is not called . Note that normal works are executed without a problem . Also low priority thread is executed without a problem while issue is seen . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : Enable USB , periodically transmit HID reports via USB through normal works . Schedule delayed work that would periodically run some check . Observe that when when frequency of normal work calls increases at some point delayed work is not scheduled . Expected behavior Delayed work should always be scheduled when expired if there is CPU time to handle normal work ( i.e. workq thread is normally scheduled ) .

In the original API development in #16648 and as merged to the topic branch : gpio_pin_configure () . was changed to not affect any interrupt configuration except : GPIO_INT_DEBOUNCE . . In #19248 this decision was reverted , and : gpio_pin_configure () . was changed to include a call to : gpio_pin_interrupt_configure () . . < URL > questioned this and was answered with the point that this is necessary to support legacy API that configures both pin and interrupt in the same call . It was described as to-be-removed-later , but there are no details/plans for how to accomplish that . This breaks the promised new API : it is no longer possible to do things like reconfigure pull state without affecting the interrupt configuration , because presence of : GPIO_INT_DISABLED . cannot be distinguished from a set of flags that does not touch the interrupt configuration , so pin configuration while interrupts are enabled will disable ( or reconfigure ) the interrupt . A potential solution is to change : GPIO_INT_DISABLED . to be a non-zero value , and so support a new : GPIO_INT_MODE_UNCHANGED . mode that has no effect . This would not work on legacy code that intentionally disables interrupts by not providing any interrupt configuration flags in the call to : gpio_pin_configure () . .	1	0

Describe the bug When exchanging an ATT MTU field larger than 256 bytes the write callbacks report wrong length field when receiving larger MTU packets . A write command of length 517 will be report as length 2 . This means that the application is not properly informed about the length of received data and data is then lost . To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior : Negotiate ATT MTU larger than 256 , ( android supports maximum 517 ) . Receive maximum ATT MTU payload in an ATT Write operation e . g Wrrite Command . Expected behavior Length of received data should be given to application Impact MTUs larger than 256 bytes are not supported and will result in data loss .

I've somehow missed commit 0fb9ea03043551c66e6f0ec14c4ef9a001255d7d from @ramakrishnapallala which adds dependencies to CONFIG_THREAD_STACK_INFO ( why this option and not CONFIG_INIT_STACKS ? ) to hci_cor e.c. However now even when I enable both CONFIG_INIT_STACKS = y and CONFIG_THREAD_STACK_INFO = y nothing gets output for the system stacks when a disconnection happens ( which is the trigger for this kind of logging ) .

Since UART interrupt mode is not supported on ARC core , we are unable to do this without having to resort to a mailbox mechanism . The current Zephyr UART driver only supports polled mode on ARC .

Reported by Andrew Boie : Many system calls will work on user-provided buffers . We need to have a way to prove that these buffers reside in a region of memory that a thread has read or write access to . We will need to define a general interface for this ( probably calling into architecture-specific APIs ) , and then add conditionally compiled hooks into it in all our kernel APIs which work on buffers . Separate JIRAs have been filed to implement this on ARM and x86 . Scope of this JIRA is to modify the system calls themselves to use this API . ( Imported from Jira ZEP-2192 )  	0	1

Commit 269f35048770cc981a1db1ecc770ded62e141291 introduced a new mechanism for loading the edtlib . EDT representation of the devicetree from kconfigfunctions.py . While this works for running kconfig.py from kconfig . cmake using execute_process () , it doesn't work when kconfigfunctions.py is loaded by the menuconfig target or any other Kconfig targets that use add_custom_target () . The reason why is that these targets ' environments do not have the location of the EDT pickle file available . This is unlike kconfig.py, which executes using the same environment as cmake itself , where edt . pickle's location is already available in the environment . Fix that by adding EDT_PICKLE to the environment for menuconfig and friends . Reported-by : Simon Guinot < URL > Signed-off-by : Mart铆 Bol铆var < URL >  	0	0

Reported by Anas Nashif : Rationale We have been adding a few features and subsystems and the only natural place right is to put those in the top level directory . This does not scale and the top-level dir will become crowded . Additional background information : The bluetooth maintainers are looking for a new home and structure for BT support in Zephyr after the addition of the controller . Bluetooth is being maintained as an individual feature across the tree and is under net/ for historical reasons . sys/ seems to be more appropriate . Proposal Move subsystems and features one level below and have all subsystems that are not core kernel features under sys/ ( or something else ) For example : * fs/ -> sys/fs * usb/ -> sys/usb * net/bluetooth -> sys/bluetooth Impact Minor ( Imported from Jira ZEP-1089 )	1	1

Describe the bug After #36366 was merged RXD and CTS pins have configured pullups , while they were floating before . This PR solved an issue with UART interfaces not being connected to anything . In most embedded devices however UART is used to communicate with peripheral chips , like 4G modems , WiFi chips ( ESP-AT ) , sensors , other MCUs , etc . In all those cases when UART is always connected , having pullups enabled increases average power consumption ( UART signal needs to fight the pullup to set a defined state ) . Additionally some of the PCB designs and/or peripheral chips already have pullups or pulldowns already in hardware . In some cases this will mean that peripheral chip won't have enough signal strength to fight configured pullups . In other cases there might be pulldowns on those lines , conflicting with pullups configured in nRF MCU ( which is the case in one of my custom boards , resulting non-working offloaded WiFi ) . To Reproduce Use Zephyr from tip of : main . branch . Expected behavior By default there should be no pull ups and no pull downs . This is the default for every GPIO when no DT flags are configured , so I expect the same behavior ( floating lines ) for UART IOs . Pullup or pulldown should be configured only on explicit request from user ( e.g. by adding/configuring device-tree properties ) . Impact Showstopper for existing projects that rely on UART lines to be floating by default . As an example in one of the projects I am working on this breaks communication between nRF and ESP8266 ( offloaded WiFi ) . Proposed solution Revert #36366 to have floating lines by default and implement device-tree flags for configuring pullups/pulldowns on user choice .	2	0

It seems that a user thread's : arch . mode . state variable is not initialized to mode :: user , for threads entering user mode . This may cause a critical error for a user thread that ends up executing in PRIV mode . The scenario is , briefly , as follows : under : CONFIG_USERSPACE = y . , a thread reads : thread . arch . mode . field in a context-switch , to select the appropriate privilege mode : thread . arch . mode . is initialized to 0 ( PRIV ) in : z_new_thread () . in : arm_userspace_enter () . , a thread drops to nPRIV mode , but the : arch . mode . variable is not updated . the variable is , finally , updated in : swap () . , i.e. when the thread intentionally yields to be switched-out and -in again . So , there seems to be a scenario , where after arm_userspace_enter () and before swap () , an IRQ triggers a context-switch . In that case , and when this thread is finally switched-back-in , it will have PRIV mode instead of nPRIV mode . Letting a user thread execute in PRIV mode outside system calls is a critical error . As we aim at claiming USER SPACE support in 1.14 , this needs to be fixed .  	0	0

Reported by Anas Nashif : As a user , I want to use Zephyr to send data using MQTT to a broker with quality of services 1 and 2 . MQTT uses a 鈥?publish/subscribe 鈥?model and requires a central MQTT broker to manage and route messages among an MQTT network鈥檚 nodes . Eclipse describes MQTT as 鈥?a many-to-many communication protocol for passing messages between multiple clients through a central broker . 鈥?It uses TCP for its transport layer , which is characterised as 鈥?reliable , ordered and error-checked . 鈥?QoS1 , At least once : The message is always delivered at least once . It might be delivered multiple times if there is a failure before an acknowledgment is received by the sender . The message must be stored locally at the sender , until the sender receives confirmation that the message has been published by the receiver . The message is stored in case the message must be sent again . QoS2 , Exactly once : The message is always delivered exactly once . The message must be stored locally at the sender , until the sender receives confirmation that the message has been published by the receiver . The message is stored in case the message must be sent again . QoS2 is the safest , but slowest mode of transfer . A more sophisticated handshaking and acknowledgement sequence is used than for QoS1 to ensure no duplication of messages occurs . ( Imported from Jira ZEP-416 )  	0	1

Problem to be solved Currently flash-controller is generated only for : zephyr , flash . chosen node . This causes problem when need to use DTS data form more than one flash controller at one . For instance when we want to use flash-simulator driver ( on qemu_x86 ) , then need to chose its DT node . This imposes that its values are presented as : DT_FLASH_* . defines . As the result target has fake ROM size etc . solution proposal Generate substitute of flowing DT macros ; : DT_FLASH_BASE_ADDRESS DT_FLASH_ERASE_BLOCK_SIZE DT_FLASH_WRITE_BLOCK_SIZE DT_FLASH_SIZE DT_FLASH_DEV_NAME . for each flash-controller node . Macros for chosen flash flash-controller might be duplicated . Looks like generation of above values based on scripts hacks , not on yaml bindings - which makes it more difficult .

The commit a5b6215a060676d07f9a5119f0a05ffa2edc8d85 added three elements to the : _kernel_openocd_offsets . array without raising the : OPENOCD_OFFSET_VERSION . as was instructed in the comment above the array . So even if OpenOCD was able to use those new values , it would not be able to determine if they exist . But since our patch to OpenOCD right now rejects unknown versions ( see zephyrproject-rtos/openocd #3 ) , I suggest to change the meaning of the : OPENOCD_OFFSET_VERSION . field to inform only about in compatible changes . For detecting backward compatible additions to the end of the array like the commit mentioned above , we should add a new variable to the . openocd_debug section that has the value : ARRAY_SIZE(_kernel_openocd_offsets ) . ( C does not allow us to put this value inside the array ) . Also note that our patch to OpenOCD is not yet upstream ( #2933 ) . I'd be willing to make pull requests with the necessary changes , both for this issue and for zephyrproject-rtos/openocd .	1	0

The subsystem shall support : - binding HW sources of entropy to the subsystem - harvesting entropy from said sources : -- the entropy sources that can generate entropy as part of their normal operation shall be able to push entropy to the subsystem when enough is generated -- the entropy sources that can supply entropy on demand shall support being polled by the subsystem - means for the user to query the subssystem for N bytes of entropy -- to be resolved : support source hoping ? or will be adding from multiple SW and HW sources enough ? - sources -- HW sources from SoC , drivers for entropy/crypto specific modules -- SW sources : --- drivers that have soft/random timings --- IRQ handler timings --- network noise The current subsystem implementation ( drivers/random ) is not sufficient as it allows only a single source of entropy to be used .

Reported by Ramesh Thomas : Currently device PM API consists of the suspend () and resume () hooks implemented by the drivers . In addition to suspend and resume , devices would also need to be set to other power states e.g. a state in which the peripherals can be clock gated . To achieve this , the following needs to be done . Define new device power states Update the device PM API - create a function that can be used to set the different device PM states . Use this function in place of the suspend/resume hooks in drivers that implement PM support . The existing device PM API will be replaced by the new API and will be marked as deprecated .

To enable code coverage , the special Kconfig option CONFIG_COVERAGE must be enabled . I have found that many tests are failing when this is turned on . Most of this is due to stack overflows , but I have found a variety of issues . We need to stop this from bit-rotting , ensuring code coverage is vital for functional safety requirements . I am going to introduce qemu_x86_coverage and mps2_an385_coverage targets . These have the same configuration but enabled CONFIG_COVERAGE = y . We will then show that coverage is working properly . The first patch is #15886 We also need to put a stop to a trend to whitelist test targets without good reason . #15836 PR does this for network test cases , but there are others .  	0	0

Is your enhancement proposal related to a problem ? Please describe . In < URL > , it mentions The bootloader expects size information at the start of the binary file , so the bin file needs to be processed first to include that information . Download the helper script from starfive-tech github repo here with a link pointing to < URL > Additionally , there are some manual steps required ( open : minicom . , use xmodem protocol , etc ) . Describe the solution you'd like It would probably be helpful to simply integrate those processes into some board-specific hook when west is invoked Most of these additional steps can be hidden from the user . E.g. the binary does not need to be prefixed by its size , but the bootloader expects that the size appear first on the wire . Additionally , the python xmodem package can be used to transmit data via python , as long as the correct uart can be specified or detected .

After looking at the commit it seems to touch IPv6/BLE code that does some checks on network interfaces .

Describe the bug In the Encryption Start Procedure , for the case when the host does not provide an LTK , the controller is supposed to send an LL_ENC_RSP before sending LL_REJECT_IND or LL_REJECT_EXT_IND . To Reproduce 1 . Modify hci_core . c , : le_ltk_request () . to always call : le_ltk_neg_reply () . : : // if ( bt_smp_request_ltk(conn , evt -> rand , evt -> ediv , ltk )) { // le_ltk_reply(handle , ltk ); // } else { le_ltk_neg_reply(handle ); // } . Build the peripheral_hr sample Connect and try bonding , expect it to fail . Observe the sniffer log . Expected behavior Send LL_ENC_RSP before LL_REJECT_IND . See the MSC in Bluetooth Core Specification v 5.1 , Vol 6 , Part D , Section 6.7 , or Part B Section 5.1.3.1 . If encryption is not supported by the Link Layer of the slave , the Link Layer of the slave shall send an LL_REJECT_IND or LL_REJECT_EXT_IND PDU with the ErrorCode set to Unsupported Remote Feature / Unsupported LMP Feature ( 0x1A ) . 鈥?The Link Layer of the slave shall then send an LL_ENC_RSP PDU . The Link Layer of the slave shall then notify the Host with the Rand and EDIV fields . Impact Possible showstopper . Peer devices may cache that the controller does not support encryption , thereby leaving the link unencrypted .

Reported by Hirally Santiago : We have parallel implementations of some interrupt and swap code in arch/x86/core/i386_sysV_abi and iamcu_abi . The iamcu versions are written in C and are easier to understand/maintain . It would be nice if we can use the C version in both ABIs , and not have to maintain two different implementations ; once execution flow transitions from assembly to C domain they should be the same . However , at the end of the day what we would like to have is just one implementation ( either C or ASM ) that is #ifdefed instead of 2 completely parallel implementations .

Describe the bug In general embedded flash driver uses addresses according to SoC memory map , so absolute address . This is true for read , write and erase calls but not for : flash_get_page_info_by_offs . call which uses offset in relation to the flash begin address . Origin of the bug : The flash shim API `struct flash_driver_api ' allows to get flash layout in shape of run-length encoded description . Because of its nature from such description can't tell what is the absolute offset of the sector . The flash shim API doesn't allow to transfer information about the flash begin offset . solution Introduce flash shim API for fetching flash base address and use it for fixing the call	2	0

Some types of exceptions ignore interrupt locking : machine checks , non-maskable interrupts , double faults . These currently all go through the exception handling path on x86_64 . In these cases , if they happen at the wrong time , the check to determine whether we need to swapgs and/or update page tables may not be correct . This can happen in between when the CPU pushes the code segment onto the stack , and the swapgs operation is performed at interrupt/exception/syscall entry ( or the reverse on the way out ) . The right thing to do in this case is a more expensive operation to read the GS_BASE MSR and figure out if it's already set to the TSS for the current CPU . We'd need an alternate exception entry point for this as other exceptions don't have this problem .	2	1

Unfortunately the implemented cache coherency management method ensuring coherency of descriptor lists is incorrect . Atmel SAM Ethernet module is using a scatter-gather technique to exchange data with the Ethernet driver . To communicate the location of the data buffers the driver sets-up a so called descriptor list . This is effectively a place in RAM containing a sequence of 32-bit words representing buffer location and its status . If cache is enabled every time the device driver updates data in the descriptor list it should theoretically also call cache clean operation . This would ensure that the data is written to RAM where it can be read by the hardware module . Unfortunately , at the same time the device driver is modifying one location in the descriptor list the hardware module can be modifying one next to it . Since cache clean operation works on a full cache line - 32 bytes in case of Atmel device - it would overwrite any such modifications done by the hardware module . As such , ensuring cache coherency using standard techniques ( cache clean / cache invalidate ) is not possible here . In case of GMAC driver the cache coherency for the descriptor lists should be implemented using the so called non-cacheable RAM region . This is described in detail in ' Cache Coherence Management Limits ' chapter of < URL > Application Note .	1	0

Describe the bug Z_ARCH_EXCEPT () is called , to signal errors directly from Software . In ARM Cortex-M , this is implemented with a synchronous SVC instruction , with code 2 . In Mainline SOCs this works well , because the kernel reserves the highest interrupt priority for the SVC Handler . In Baseline cores , however , we do not reserve an interrupt priority for the SVC . So if Z_ARCH_EXCEPT () is invoked from an interrupt with the highest priority , the SVC Call won't be able to execute and will trigger a synchronous ( Escalated ) hard fault . To Reproduce We have a bug report already for this : #18590 Impact We are not able to infer stack-fail checks in Baseline ARM CPUs with the STACK Sentinel feature . We do get a system exception , however , so the user is still getting some information that something went wrong .	2	1

Currently FCB is able to work with flash devices that erase to 0xFF values . Since it's implementation new devices have appeared that use non-0xFF erase values ( 0x00 ) , which is not supported by the FCB as it relies on 0xFF as an erased/empty value in some cases . Describe the solution you'd like Make FCB flash erase value independent . Describe alternatives you've considered There is none as long as FCB is to be used . Additional context The flash API now supports : flash_get_parameters . that returns : flash_parameters . structure that has : erase_value . member , which is initialized by driver with the erase value .	2	1

Describe the bug During the upgrade to TI SDK 2.40 , the SimpleLink WiFi host driver code has moved to using the dynamic memory model . This only works well if malloc () is thread-safe , but the implementation in newlib does not appear to be . So it is best to revert back to using static memory allocation in the driver , the way it used to be before the upgrade . Impact Memory corruption issues might occur if SimpleLink host driver is used concurrently with other threads calling malloc () .

Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is . In < URL > the spi_cfg struct has not been properly initialized , and has whatever was on the stack for the struct . particularly this means taht the . cs property may contain garbage . The following code in the driver gets triggered : : data -> ctx . config = config ; 8005a90 : 9b0a ldr r3 , [ sp , #40 ] ; 0x28 8005a92 : 601f str r7 , [ r3 , #0 ] if ( ctx -> config -> cs && ctx -> config -> cs -> gpio_dev ) { 8005a94 : 2900 cmp r1 , #0 8005a96 : f000 8162 beq . w 8005d5e < spi_stm32_transceive+0x49a > . I get a bus fault on the attempt to deref ctx -> config -> cs -> gpio_dev , as cs is garbage . either explicitly setting . cs = 0 , or intializing the struct with = { 0 } works to avoid the bus fault . Expected behavior working code on all platforms with spi . Presumably will work on platforms or not , depending on how cs is being handled out of the box for each board . Impact What impact does this issue have on your progress ( e.g. , annoyance , showstopper ) tedious inability to get viable spi demostrations , so ... shrugs big for me . Screenshots or console output If applicable , add a screenshot ( drag-and-drop an image ) , or console logs ( cut-and-paste text and put a code fence (```) before and after , to help explain the issue .

This works fine in C , but if you define your main function in a C++ file , because the function name isn't the magically special-cased ' main ' anymore , the function name gets mangled into something along the lines of : _Z15zephyr_app_mainv . ( for : void main(void ) . ) , which results in the main function getting silently ignored . I'm not sure there's actually any way to make the macro work : you can't use : asm . to specify the name of the symbol in the definition of a function , only the declaration . If it's possible to require main to be : void(void ) . , ~ the macro could be replaced by a forward declaration of : void main(void ) asm('zephyr_app_main ' ) . ~ an : extern ' C ' . forward declaration of zephyr_app_main could be added : #if defined(__cplusplus ) . , but this might break existing code .

Reported by Carles Cufi : As a Zephyr user I would like to be able to determine which applications are meant for consumption as-is and which others are starting points for me to add the code required to implement a product . Currently all applications are under samples/ . The issue is that a new type of application , the ' firmware ' or ' build ' application has appeared with the introduction of samples/bluetooth/hci-uart . This application actually transforms Zephyr into the firmware build of a Bluetooth Low Energy controller , which will probably undergo qualification at some point . As such , it is not directly intended as a starting point , but rather as a ' product ' in itself . A solution to this confusing state of affairs could be to further subdivide the applications into multiple categories , one per folder : apps products/firmware/builds samples ** refdesigns ( Imported from Jira ZEP-1092 )	1	1

Describe the bug QEMU special key handling ( : CTRL+A , ... . ) is broken on : qemu_cortex_a53 . . For example , when you press the : CTRL+a , a . key sequence , QEMU should exit , but that doesn't work ; same goes for : CTRL+a , c . that is supposed to bring up console . It is necessary to : kill -9 . the QEMU pid in order to exit QEMU . To Reproduce Run any test/sample on : qemu_cortex_a53 . . Expected behavior : CTRL+a , ... . key sequences work . Impact The usability of : qemu_cortex_a53 . , the only emulated AArch64 platform , is limited .

While it is possible that this is a QEMU bug , it is more likely that we have an incorrect DTS configuration for one of the interrupts ( e.g. specifying edge-triggered interrupts as level-triggered ) .	1	0

It does not currently include the destination address ( DST ) set by the sender . The mesh models spec describes various rules for handling identical transactions . For example in 3.3.2.2.2 it says ' ... it shall set the Generic Level state to the Level field of the message , unless the message has the same values for the SRC , DST , and TID fields as the previous message received within the last 6 seconds ' . Note that the condition includes matching on the DST value . It's possible for a device to change the DST address it is using . For example , you can imagine a rotary wall dimmer with a ' zone ' selector . The selector may have two positions : 1 - group A and 2 - group B . The selector affects what DST the dimmer uses when sending Delta Set messages . Summary : please make the DST field from RX messages available in the API , presumably by adding it to bt_mesh_msg_ctx . Thanks	1	1
