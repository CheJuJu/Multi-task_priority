Currently there is no way of delaying an ad to appear only after the images have finished loading . Since animated ads are often made up of several independent images this leads to the ad appearing piece by piece ; and unless loading indicators have been disabled on all images it's also full of scattered dot animations . In JS based ads we always preload images since we believe that not showing an ad for a slightly longer period of time is better than showing a partially rendered one that looks broken , even if it's just for a split second . This is also the behavior that our clients are used to . It would therefore be very useful to have a mechanism for specifying which images need to be loaded before the ad is shown . Perhaps this could be added in the form of a ' preload ' attribute on amp-img so that some images can be marked as essential while others can still be loaded progressively ?	2	1

Consider this scenario I want the notification to show once a day/week . Currently , after a user dismissed amp-user-notification , the dismissal state is stored in local storage . The notification will never show again until the storage is cleared . I know I can use the : data-show-if-href . API to implement this from server-side . But I believe that it's reasonable to control this by using local storage and a little of client-side calculation . Something as simple as setting an attribute : dismissal-expires='86400 ' . would be pretty straightforward . Suggestion Add the attribute : dismissal-expires . to amp-user-notification . The attribute value means how long should we respect the stored dismissal state . It would be measured by second ( millisecond's probably unnecessary ) .

Hi @rudygalfi and team , we're looking to add engaged time support to the Parse.ly analytics tracker . Following #1296 and examples I'm seeing in the code , it seems that the recommended approach is to implement a timer trigger that uses a special request which appends : ${totalEngagedTime } . . Parse.ly's JavaScript tracker has an engaged time implementation that sends a ' heartbeat ' pixel every 10.5 s which includes the total time engaged since page load and the amount of time engaged since the last heartbeat pixel . This greatly simplifies the server-side logic we have to do by allowing us to sum these increments . In reviewing the analytics spec and available variable substitutions , I'm a stumped on how to reproduce ' time engaged since last timer trigger ' without a tricky server-side solution that tries to compute the delta between : totalTimeEngaged . on chronological pixels . Would you and the team have any suggestions on how to proceed ?	1	1

I'm using AMP's latest build and one big issue I have is my stories tend to develop over time . For example , I've covered events with them or breaking news . Users have really enjoyed the format and I'm planning to implement paywalled versions -- but the largest complaint by far is that the user needs to do an F5 to see if there's new content . It seems lime : amp-live-list . could be a candidate to make that happen if it were allowed to be a sibling of the amp-story body , but it isn't . Really want I need is a way to check the server and tell them to refresh , which would be adequate . Under today's rules that doesn't seem possible ? Examples : < URL > < URL >	2	1

One for each combo of : : type = slides . / : type = carousel . : lightbox . /no- : lightbox . The specific tagspec for : type = carousel . /no- : lightbox . specifies a : dispatch_key . which makes it the ONLY tagspec that is matched if : type = carousel . is present . This means that the : type = carousel . / : lightbox . version is unreachable in the validator , except possibly to match certain guaranteed to error out cases , and in those case it will simply make error messages worse . In other words , it is impossible to create a document containing : : < amp-carousel type = carousel lightbox layout = FIXED height = 1 width = 1 > ... < /amp-carousel > . Even though there is a tagspec written that would allow it . There are two possible , and very simple fixes : - Remove the : type = carousel . / : lightbox . validator version if we don't want this combination to exist . - Remove the : dispatch_key . on the : type = carousel . /no- : lightbox . version if we do want that combination to exist .

Technically in this case , the carousel is not a direct child of the : < amp-selector > . , so the : < amp-selector > . validation rule is possibly being a bit too restrictive , but either way , it seems like the reference point solution isn't sufficient to allow validation of : < amp-carousel [ lightbox ] > . inside of : < amp-selector > . .	2	0

After discussing with @erwinmombay and @rsimha , it appears that our current canary build runs with a < URL > rather than a < URL > . The result is that we can't guarantee that what is being tested for ~ 1% of users in the canary is the same thing that gets rolled out to 100% of users . For example an experiment may be turned on in canary but not turned on in prod . In the current system the ~ 1% of users will have the experiment on , but when the release gets rolled out to 100% the experiment will be off . Problems may not be exposed during the ~ 1% canary in this scenario -- e.g. if the experiment enabled for the ~ 1% of users hides an issue in the release that is only present when the experiment is off . We'd like to have a system that has these features : When we push a build that has been running at ~ 1% to 100% of users , the 100% should be the same binary and the same config that the ~ 1% was using . We want to maintain the ability to turn on experiments for a subset of users without requiring that the experiment is automatically turned on for all users as a result of the release process . ( Ideally config pushes would also be independent of the binary pushes , but that's beyond the scope of this issue . )	1	0

Describe the new feature or change to an existing feature you'd like to see Hello , I have a use case that I haven't found anything that mentions it in the docs . I want to be able to run a custom click handler for each auto-complete item . This will enable me to achieve this use case . Describe alternatives you've considered I tried to use a single amp-script that does everything using javascript without any other amp components . It fell short and I had to redo everything using amp components , like auto complete , form , bind , etc . Additional context The feature I'm trying to implement is an amp autocomplete that lets you search for areas , once you click an item , a custom handler should intercept that , does some transformations and saves generated url to local storage , after that the form is submitted to the backend where the user is redirected to that specific search area they clicked on . When this user comes back in the future , they'll find a list of their previous searches below the amp autocomplete using an amp-list component . Hope my use case is clear enough .	2	1

What's the issue ? In Chrome , when the autoplay or loop attribute is put on an amp-carousel the animation between slides ' breaks ' half way through , and just teleports to the slide you were transitioning through . How do we reproduce the issue ? we've made this test site with different carousels , and noted when this animation error occurs . < URL > Go through the different examples and you can see that whenever either loop , autoplay or both is set , the animation breaks halfway through . We've found out that this is all caused by the scroll-snap-align css property , which is being set on the individual slides that are animating back and forth . try using this very illegal css rule in devtool , and you will see that the animation is now buttery smooth : : . i-amphtml-carousel-slide-item { scroll-snap-align : none ! important ; } . What browsers are affected ? This is definitely affecting Chrome This is also a problem in Edge , but instead of breaking half-way through , the animation is just super fast with scroll-snap-align : center .

As we create more complex components , there is more default text that we need to include ( e.g. labels and titles , whether visible or for screen readers ) . Allowing page authors to change these defaults ( whether to translate them or simply to change them ) is currently done through custom attributes on the elements but this approach is not very scalable and muddies the component's API . We should come up with an i18n and text customization approach that 1 . Allows us to ship translations for default text we have in components . 2 . Allows page authors to override/translate any default text . 3 . Support interpolation . ( e.g. ' page {{ x }} of {{ y }}') We should research what a good existing approach for this is . A starting thought could be : a JSON based system which is just a map of : < UniqueTextKey , Value > . ( e.g. : ' { amp . LightBox . nextButtonTitle ' : ' See next Item ' } . ) . Components use the key instead of hardcoding the text and runtime does the repalcement and interpolation . We provide a translated map for English and a few other languages and page authors can override any key with their value of choice by providing a partial override map . @cramforce @dvoytenko @rudygalfi @ericlindley -g	2	1
