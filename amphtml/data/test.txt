They should be present for extensions that are opted-in , even before the extension has loaded . The current behavior contradicts this comment in the code : < URL > The above logic living in v0 . js is not actually useful since the loader is never actually rendered until the element has been upgraded/built . This is because the loading state being toggled relies on being : isInViewport_ . : < URL > Note : the else branch here calls : prepareLoading_ . , but it does not actually show the loader . It creates the elements for the loader , but in a hidden state .

The goal of this round of refactoring is to extract common code pattern from existing 3P ad network implementations . The reuse of well tested code means : less code and less effort for both contributors and reviewers . - Deprecate util functions : checkData(allowedFields ) . and : validateDataExists(mandatoryFields ) . and introduce : validateData(mandatoryFields , optionalFields ) . . Right now many 3P code don't take full advantage of both functions . For example , doubleclick isn't using : validateDataExists . to check mandatory fields , which otherwise can potentially avoid mis-configuration on real publisher side . ( This < URL > failed to load ads silently because of missing required : data-slot . attribute ) . One validation function would be harder to mis-use by 3P ad network . - Extract util methods that 1 ) create element that inherit attributes from the : data . object and append to doc . 2 ) load script from a URL that takes : data . object as query string . As a reference , refactoring round one is here : #4190	2	0

This can be useful if you are scaling up/down an element during a user gesture and you want to prevent re-layout due to size change while the user is in the middle of the gesture . Currently , you can use : setAsOwner . to control the lifecycle callbacks of children , but that is not ideal as you may forget to call some lifecycle methods at the correct time .	2	1

Currently , if an AMP page makes use of an amp extension ( eg : < amp-foo > . ) the AMP validator requires that the matching script tag be located on the page , for example : : < script async custom-element='amp-foo ' src='<URL> . However , the reverse is not true . You can include : amp-foo- 0.1 . js . without the presence of any : < amp-foo > . tag and it is not a validation error . This results in an anti-pattern of folks generating a header for a site that includes the superset of all javascript extensions that they may want to use , even if a given page does not use that extension . The AMP cache can strip unused extensions , but the origin is still affected . See < URL > : ' User Experience > Developer Experience > Ease of Implementation . ' When in doubt , do what?????? best for the end user experience , even if it means that it?????? harder for the page creator to build or for the library developer to implement . I'd like to propose that for new extensions , we enforce both requirements . If : amp-new-extension- 0.1 . js . is on the page but : < amp-new-extension > . isn't , for example , that would be a validator error . Existing extensions would be grandfathered in , at least for now . The big risk I see is that a developer using the superset header might add one of these new extensions to their header and accidentally invalidate their entire site without realizing it .  	1	2

I noticed that the recently contributed amp-analytics . js says : isLayoutSupported(layout ) { return true ; } I don't think that's cool , it's too loose and means that any layout can be attached to this tag , but that kind of makes no sense because an analytics thing doesn't really have a layout - or does it ? If the analytics engine creates a single pixel , then it should be FIXED , like amp-pixel . This means it should be registered in src/layout . js as an element with natural dimensions . Otherwise , if it doesn't have any pixels , I think it should go like amp-font , so that means it will have layout = nodisplay required on the tag ( as in , users will have to write it ) . If there should be some nodisplay default , then it probably needs to be registered in src/layout . js , much like the natural dimensions . But that mechanism doesn't exist yet .

Currently doubleclick fast fetch refresh limits subsequent sizes if a previous request resized the slot smaller and the slots cannot be resized at the time of the refresh request ( as its within the viewport and would trigger reflow ) . This limits eligible demand and thus hurts monetization . Will change the default behavior to not resize the slot if refresh is enabled in order to ensure higher monetization for later refresh requests despite this being a non-ideal UX ( creative centered within white space ) . Pubs can override this behavior by adding a new option to refresh config ( field name/place TBD ) . cc/ @ampproject /a4a	2	1

Encountered the following validation error ' The attribute ' autoplay ' in tag ' amp-story >> amp-video ' is set to the invalid value ' true ' . ' for an AMP Story . When using React , < URL > ( for example , if : autoplay . is present , React default it to : ' autoplay = true ' . ) , which matches HTML behavior . However in AMP , for attributes that don't need a value , any value specified , including ' true ' , throws an error . This applies to the autoplay and a few other similar attributes ( e.g. , the ' standalone ' attribute in ' ' ) . For context , for these attributes that would generally have no value because the value has no meaning in html , the validator explicitly prohibits any value other than empty string ' and the attribute name e .. g , : ' autoplay = autoplay ' . or : ' standalone = standalone ' . . The reasoning behind this rule is that : ' autoplay = false ' . or : ' autoplay = no ' . wouldn't make sense because the presence of the attribute itself with any value does in fact enable autoplay , so to avoid confusion all values are prohibited by the validator . Workaround : Tools like React need to always include a value , so the : ' attribute = attribute ' . workaround is allowed by the validator for this reason .

We have set up our PWA to use AMP as a data source via AMP Shadow . While testing the implementation we discovered that AMP Shadow doesn't behave well when navigating through multiple AMP Shadow instances , that is when navigating from an AMP Shadow page to another one via the SPA shell the browser crashes and restarts itself with the following native message ' A Problem has occurred with this webpage so it was reloaded ' . This could happen going from the second AMP Shadow instance to the third one and sometimes even from the first instance to the second one . Technical details When the user taps on a link within the AMP Shadow page that is linking to another AMP Shadow page , we kill the AMP Shadow instance using the : ampShadow . close () . method , and additionally we also add an asynchronous wait time of 50ms as suggested by one of the great AMP engineers , then we start the process of loading and injecting the new AMP Shadow instance . We are using the streaming API , not involving the non-streaming API because of < URL > Once streaming API graduates from experimental , the non-streaming API will be deprecated . This issue seems to be happening specifically on iOS but might be on other OS or browsers as well while we didn't notice anything yet ( we stopped testing for now because of this issue ) . This issue might be related to #23575 and please see our code setup over there as it's the same codebase . How do we reproduce the issue ?

BTW ???the proper way to serve up images with different image ratios is the tag , or our custom media attribute . From dvoytenko : It should only work for layout = responsive .

In order to prevent a race condition it creates the service promise as soon as the JS loads and well before it's had a chance to parse it's config . If there is a config error what should it do ? Just throw Call : user () . assert () . and be done . The upside of this is it's simple the downside is anything waiting on the service promise just hangs . This is the current state of play . Reject Reject the service promise . This has the advantage that the consuming extension can catch and make a decision about how to handle the error . Fails ' safe ' if the consumer doesn't : catch () . the error . Allows for meaningful error messages : : [ amp-user-notification ] geo service error : [ amp-geo ] Syntax error , unable to parse JSON . The downside is that if nothing is waiting on the promise you also get an uncaught promise error . Resolve with error status and throw Resolving the promise with an error status ( but not an Error object ) allows consuming services to handle the error and still logs it . Downside the consumer has to know how to handle the error status , it doesn't fail safe . This feels like something we should have a standard way of handling .
